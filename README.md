# Is College Worth It?

An interactive, data-driven scrollytelling web project that explores the question: **Is college worth the investment?**  
Using real U.S. education, earnings, and loan data, the project presents two contrasting narratives—*Yes* and *No*—through immersive D3.js visualizations.

## Overview

This project visualizes the return on investment (ROI) of higher education by combining storytelling, interactive maps, and custom visualizations. Users navigate an ASU-inspired campus map and encounter data at each location, comparing the financial benefits and risks of pursuing a college degree.

The experience is designed to let users form their own conclusions based on evidence rather than opinion.
